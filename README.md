# 🎴 On-Chain Card Suit Guessing Game  

### 🧠 A Beginner-Friendly Blockchain Game Built with Solidity  

---

## 🧩 **Project Description**

The **Card Suit Guessing Game** is a simple **on-chain Ethereum/Celo smart contract** designed for beginners to understand how blockchain randomness, events, and Ether transfers work.  

In this game, you **guess a card suit** — Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades — and if your guess matches the randomly generated suit, you **win double your money! 💰**

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The randomness used here is **not cryptographically secure** and should be used **for learning purposes only**.

---

## 🚀 **What It Does**

1. A player calls the `guessSuit()` function and sends a small amount of Ether (minimum `0.001 ETH`).  
2. The smart contract generates a **pseudo-random suit** using on-chain data.  
3. If the player's guess matches the generated suit, they win **2× their bet** instantly.  
4. The game result is permanently stored on-chain for full transparency.
